  description: According to the reports of the enlightened Owl, Winter was simply
    impassable. The cold would turn any savvy travelers packing. Those with less
    wherewithal would freeze in their tracks, never to be heard from again. Thus,
    the sage dedicated his remaining time to combatting the cold.
