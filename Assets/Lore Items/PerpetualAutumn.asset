  title: Perpetual Autumn
  description: 'Known for the rich colors of Fall, many retreat to this place in
    order to escape the brutal Winter, though they can never return. Through the
    falling leaves, three trees stand, each representing a different element: Thunder,
    Nature, and Aqua. These elements guard the entrance to Winter.'
