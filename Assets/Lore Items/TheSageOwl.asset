  title: The Sage Owl
  description: In the Autumnal region, a wise owl was known far and wide. He would
    travel throughout the kingdom to give his wisdom. As he grew older he fell ill.
    He determined that none should attempt to cross the Winterlands as he once did,
    sealing it off from Autumn with three magical seals.
